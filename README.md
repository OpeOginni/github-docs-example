# Writing Good Documentaion

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, share** code.
A good __Cloud Engineer__ uses Codeblocks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.

- In order to create codeblocks in markdown you need to use three backticks(`)
- Not to be condused with quotation (') 
```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage:
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")
```

- When you can you should attempt syntax highlighting to your codeblocks
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage:
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")
```

- Make note of where the backtick button is located.
- It should appear above the tab key.
- But it may vary based on your keyboard layout.

Good Cloud engineers use codeblocks for both Code and Errors that appear in the console.
```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
        2: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in `<main>'
        1: from (irb):1
RuntimeError: This is a custom error message
```
> Here is an example of using a codeblock for an error that appears in bash

## Step 3 - Use Github Flavourd Markdown Task lists

Github extends Markdown to have a list where you can check off items. [<sup>[1]</sup>](#external-references)

# Step 4 - Use Emojis (Optional)

GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) supports emoji shortcodes.
Here are some examples:

| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | `:cloud:` | :cloud: |
| Cloud with lighting | `:cloud_with_lighting` | üå©Ô∏è |
| Soccer | `:soccer:` | :soccer: |

# Step 5 - how to create a table


You can use the following markdown format to create tables:

```md
| Name | Shortcode | Emoji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud | `:cloud:` | :cloud: |
| Cloud with lighting | `:cloud_with_lighting` | üå©Ô∏è |
```
Github extends the functionality of Markdown tables to provide more alignment and table cell formatting options. [<sup>[2]</sup>](#external-references)

- Make note of where the pipe keyboard key is located.
- It should appear above return or enter key
- but it may vary based on your keyboard layout.
